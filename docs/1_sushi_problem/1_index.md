# The Problem presented by SUSHI

## Problem

The problem SUSHI tries to address is the **Information Retrieval in Archives** [1]:

- **Generally**, Information Retrieval has a **full collection** of materials that can be **indexed** and, based on a user's query, there's a suggestion of materials for it [1].
- Archives collect **unique and irreplaceable historical materials** and put greater emphasis on acquisition and preservation than on access [1].
- The access has stringent **resource constraints** [1].
    * It isn't practical to digitize many individual documents [1].
    * The documents are described at **higher levels of aggregation**, such as folders, boxes, or segments [1].
- This situation creates challenges for searches, because different parts of an archive often are **arranged differently** [1].
    * Materials in a collection are organized as the original order that when they were in active use, but the **description stops before the level of individual documents** [1].
        1. Space exploration: program (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo...)
            - Component (space suit, thruster, radio...)
        2. Diplomacy: country (Sweden, Uganda, Japan...)
            - Topic (agriculture, education, economy...)

Some data that shows how real the problem of digitizing individual documents in Archives is:

- **U.K. National Archives has 14 billion printed pages**, which if put in a single stack would stretch halfway around the world [1].
- **26k archives in the US**, with low level of funding [1].
- **97.6%** of US National Archives materials is not digitized [1].
- In the first five months of 2023, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) digitized **13 million pages from their holdings of 11.7 billion pages**, 121,000 pages per day, it would take **375 years to digitize the paper holdings of that one repository**.

The problem is also real in Brazil:

-  Despite a high rate of adhesion by institutions, where **77% engage in digitization, only 43% make even a part of their collections available to the public online**. The primary causes for this gap include:
    * Lack of funding;
    * Shortage of qualified personnel for digital dissemination;
    * Persistent issues with cataloging and digital storage.

In [First Solutions](./3_first_solutions.md), it is possible to find more explaning for the problem and the need of a solution.

## What the problem causes

The problem above brings a greater **burden onto those who want to find things in an archive**:

- Searches must **spend weeks and hundreds or thousands of dollars per search** on the following process [1]:
    * Learn were the collections are stored;
    * Learn how the collections are organized;
    * They must (depending on the level of digitization) travel to the archive;
    * Request access to containers that MIGHT contain what they are looking for;
    * Look through those materials.
