# SUSHI Research Documentation

This is the documentation of mine (Victor Leão) research being conducted related to the **NTCIR-18 SUSHI (Searching Unseen Sources for Historical Information) Task - Subtask A**. I created this documentation to help me find easier the important studies and topics I've been studying.

My master's thesis is related to explaning and analyzing the results of already developed systems and their runs submissions for the 2025 NTCIR-18 SUSHI Subtask A.

## Documentation

The documentation starts with the [problem SUSHI addresses](1_sushi_problem/1_index.md). Next, the [solution proposed](1_sushi_problem/2_solution.md) is explained.
