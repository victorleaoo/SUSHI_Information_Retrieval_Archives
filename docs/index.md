# SUSHI Research Documentation

This is the documentation of mine (Victor Leão) research being conducted related to the **NTCIR-18 SUSHI (Searching Unseen Sources for Historical Information) Task - Subtask A**. I created this documentation to help me find easier the important studies and topics I've been studying.

My master's thesis is related to explaning and analyzing the results of already developed systems and their runs submissions for the 2025 NTCIR-18 SUSHI Subtask A.

## Documentation

The documentation starts with the [problem SUSHI addresses](1_sushi_problem/1_index.md). Next, the [solution proposed](1_sushi_problem/2_solution.md) is explained. The [First Solutions](1_sushi_problem/3_first_solutions.md) exposes the start of the research for Information Retrieval in Archives.

Following, the Design of the SUSHI SubTask A is done in three different steps:

1. [Data Collections](2_sushi_design/2_data.md): explore the task data collections;
2. [Evaluation](2_sushi_design/3_evaluation.md): explain main metrics;
3. [Run Submissions](2_sushi_design/4_runs.md): how the run submissions works.

The [SUSHI Submissions](3_sushi_solutions/1_index.md) discusses briefly about the systems submissions made for the SUSHI design. It also exposes the **hard topics** problem.

[Explainable Information Retrieval (ExIR)](4_ir_explain/1_index.md) is approached, in order to show main fundamentals and how it can contribute to be a solution for the hard topics problem. The main [ExIR methods](4_ir_explain/2_models.md) that can be used for the SUSHI context are also presented.

Finally, the [Proposed Work](5_proposed_work/1_index.md) based on the **hard topics** problem and the possible ExIR solutions is detailed.
