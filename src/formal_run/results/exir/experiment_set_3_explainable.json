KISSINGER  COPIEF TO: THE WHITE HOUSE  J  'c,-/pc Subject: Argentine Sensitivities Toward Brazil  n_ Sharply Increase  Argentina is extremely concerned that the United  States may have selected Brazil as its chosen instrument  in dealing with Latin America and that the United States  may be encouraging or permitting Brazil to establish a  form of hegemony over the rest of Latin America. The  long-standing Argentine animosity toward and envy of  Brazil have been sharply exacerbated by the visit of  President Medici of Brazil to Washington and the resultant  press reports suggesting that the U.S. has singled out \"5  Brazil as the most important nation in Latin America. A ^  rash of editorials has broken out in the Argentine press  decrying what they assume to be official U.S. Government y  policy to place Brazil at the head of Latin America. The ^  Medici visit has also triggered off a flurry of rumors s\\  and speculation about a possible U.S. invitation to  Argentine President Lanusse to visit Washington.  Argentine officials have queried Embassy officers  about press statements emanating from Washington during  the visit of the Brazilian president which suggested that  the U.S. Government considers Brazil to be the most  important country in Latin America. In pursuance of their  apprehensions about Argentina's being discarded, senior  Foreign Ministry officials in Buenos Aires have told  United States officials that they believe Argentina has  an important although modest role to play in the Southern  Cone, exercising a moderating influence over countries  such as Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and, to some  extent, Chile.  CONFIDENTIAL MICROFILMED  *«A-U/AT0 -.vif -S.TOIVW.1 BY S/S-I POLITICAL AFFAIRS & RELATIONS The memorandum from the U.S. Department of State expresses Argentina‘s growing concern over the U.S. favoring Brazil in Latin American affairs, particularly after Brazilian President Medici‘s Washington visit. Argentine officials fear being sidelined and have voiced their belief in Argentina‘s significant role in the region. The situation has led to increased tension and negative press in Argentina regarding U.S. policy."

He is  reasonably well-liked personally, and some of the bitterness created by the  cassation process which was used to secure his victory seems to have dis­ appeared. The trouble lies in the rivalries and arguments which have plagued  AREHA since it first came into existence in this state, and which are by no  means being shelved for the sake of presenting a united front to the MDB foe.

Revised Bank of Brazil accounts indicate that the net foreign asset  position of the Brazilian monetary authorities improved by only $3«9  million during the first semester of 19^7, not $24.1 million as pre­ viously reported. Following relative stability during the first semester  the net foreign asset position deteriorated sharply during July and August  by slightly more than $100 mi Hi or. and weekly estimates show a further  decline of almost $90 million tnrough October 20 as shown in Table I.  2. The deterioration in net foreign assets during July was anticipated  owing to the low level of coffee receipts and the heavy repayments of  suppliers credits and project loans during that month, but August should  have shewn some improvement. The major cause of the deteriorating  foreign exchange position which continued into October has been heavy  speculation against the cruzeiro. This speculation started early in  August and intensified following the implementation of Central Bank  Resolution 62 control on the manual market which was interpreted as a  sign of a low level of exchange reserves (See A-204, August 31* 1967).  3. The exchange speculation took two major forms: early closing of  exchange contracts for imports and financial remittances through In­ struction 289. As importers closed exchange contracts for imports,  the commercial banks obtained the necessary exchange cover from the  Bank of Brazil (agent for the Central Bank). Exchange cover provided  to the \"private banks rose from an average of $7 million per month  earlier in 1967 to $44 million in July, $80 million in August and $124  million in September.

Environmental problems are the concern of a very small element among Brazil's'  technical elite and the editorial writers of several of the country's more re­ sponsible newspapers. Probably as a consequence of local awareness of growing  U.S. concern with environmental problems as well as the growing magnitude of  such problems in Brazil, the beginnings of policy attention have emerged here in  recent years.  Efforts to control water pollution and to re-plant the country's disappearing  forest reserves are receiving particular attention. The Amazon as an area is re­ garded by many literate Brazilians as one of the country's contributions to world  environmental reserves, but foreign interest in this area is received with sus­ picion by most Brazilians. Notwithstanding this interest, the possibilities of  world cooperation in environmental matters appears to make more sense to Brazil­ ian engineers and scientists than to the Brazilian Foreign Office. (During his  recent trip to Brazil, AID's Science Advisor, Dr, Schweitzer, was informed by a  Foreign Office spokesman^ that international cooperation on environmental pro­ blems was a rich country's luxury.)  USAID makes a special effort to minimize unfavorable environmental side effects  on its development projects. For example, pollution control is included in the  engineering design of those capital projects we support directly. The malaria erad­ ication PASA group is well aware of the potential risks of using DDT,and currently  new forms of this insecticide, which hopefully will break-down more rapidly, are  being tried on an experimental basis. There is, of course, in any major development  project an impact on environment, and AID/W guidelines for better judging this  impact would be welcomed.  The remainder of this airgram comments on specific questions raised in AID's  A-688.  a) Environmental problems in Brazil will be presented in the following three  categories: First, pollution, the focus of environmental discussion here as in  the United States; second, natural resources conservation, of PAGE  1 OF PAGES  5  DRAFTED BY s igned on  RWMiller:cnf (draft)  RJBallantyne:mf OFFICE  DPEC P.HONE NO.  337 OATE  18 May '70 APPROVED BY;  A/DOM :RJBallantyne ^jfa^Y  AID AND OTHER CLEARANCES  ADOM:RJBloomfield (in draft) ADPR : HHarrison (in draft)  ARDO:WRodgers (in draft)  HRO: LABerry (in draft) UNCLASS.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) emphasizes minimizing environmental impacts in its projects and seeks better guidelines for assessing these effects."

ALAIC is an aasociation of some 1,700 tanning firms in Argentina,  Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, Columbia, Mexico,  and Venezuela, affiliated with the International Council of Tanners.  The association, which has been in existence about one year, is dedicated  to the promotion of the tanning trade and the exchange of technical  information concerning the industry in Latin America. Association  representatives in Argentina estimate that there are roughly 170 million  head of cattle in ALAIC countries, permitting an annual production  of 28 million hides. ALAIC affiliates produce approximately $US 300  million of tanned hides per year, of which Argentina represents 25$.  The current President of ALAIC is Francisco GRUNWALD of Argentina,  who is also Secretary of the Argentine Chamber of Tanners (Cgmara  Gremial de Curtidores). At the Sao Paulo Convention, the Presidency  will automatically rotate to a Brazilian and the Vice Presidency to  a Colombian for a year term, according to ALAIC1s present statutes.

Neither is an old family in the tradit­ ional sense, however. On both sides^the families were more or  less established by General Garastazu Medici's grandfathers.  His Medici grandfather emigrated from Italy late in the last  century and attempted to enter Brazil but was unable to do so  because he was not able to establish that he and his wife were  legally married. !Ie was ultimately successful in gaining en­ trance to Uruguay and the family finally settled on the Uru­ guayan border with Brazil. The General s Garastazu grandfather  was a more colorful character. A cattle drover and cowboy, he  drifted iiito the region as a young man late in the last cen­ tury, probably from either Argentina or Uruguay. By the time  of his death at the age of eighty two he had spawned a large  family and acquired considerable holdings in land and cattle.  According to family legend he could ait a horse as well as his  sons and grandsons almost to the tin^ of his death, and even  ride them into the ground, Garastazu is a Basque name, and the  General's grandfather combined the characteristics for which the  race is famous - personal toughness, shrewdness, stubbornessii  and taciturnity.

Cocoa Zone  The drafting officer, Vice Consul Raymond Collins^and BPAO  John Mason attended a conference of mayors at Ilheus from  June 28-30. Organized by the young and energetic Mayor of  Ilheus, Nerival Barros (ARENA), the conference attracted most  of the mayors in the cocoa zone as well as Governor Luis  Viana Filho, State Secretaries of the Interior and Municipal­ ities and representatives of SUDENE, SUDEPE, SESP, BNH, SAAE,  SERFHAU, DERBA etc. The cocoa zone is located on the south­ ern litoral of Bahia and maintains a population in excess of  1,000,000. Though cocoa has long been Bahia's leading ex­ port, the wealth accumulated through its cultivation and in­ dustrialization has not filtered down to the people living  in the area.  The purpose of the conference was to focus attention on the  technical and social needs of the cocoa zone and to formu­ late comprehensive regional planning fully integrated with  state and federal development schemes. At the conclusion  of the conference a loose organization called the ^Alliance  of Mayors in the Reconcavo\" was formed. It will be/respon­ sibility of this group to undertake an inventory of the re­ gion's most pressing needs, draw up specific projects in  such fields as health, education, housing, communications  and power and channel these projects to an appropriate state,  federal or international agency for consideration.

Ellis, DOM / DATE: July 7, 1970  THRU: Mr. William Gelabert, ADPRK -fn/L  FROM : William L. Rodgers, Chief, ARD0$^  SUBJECT: Seed Industry Development Project  512-15-130-247.3  During a recent PROP review session for the Seed Industry Development  project held in the Program Office it was pointed out that most of the  project targets, as stated in the present PROP, will have been achieved by  the scheduled phase-out date of approximately March 31, 1972. However,  ARDO felt strongly that certain of the project activities will not have  been completely realized to any outstanding degree by scheduled phase out  and therefore should be extended beyond that date. Specifically, I feel  that in the areas of seed research and promotion the project has not as  yet made any significant, lasting contribution. This is due largely to  U.S. personnel and financial limitations. (In 1968 the contract was  reduced from 5 to 2 American technicians).  Accordingly, ARDO has recently submitted budget worksheets  providing a cost breakdown for the extension of contract LA-165 with  Mississippi State University to March 31, 1974. This two-year extension  recommendation is also presently being spelled out in a revised draft of  the PROP for Seed Industry Development to be submitted to AID/W.  It should further be pointed out that the extension of the project  in the areas of seed research and promotion would also have a definite  complementary role to play in the various commodity research projects  which are included in the pending agricultural research loan. I strongly  feel that this new role for Mississippi State University will be  important and basic to our overall agriculture research program.  Your favorable consideration of the above indicated extension is  hereby officially requested.  Buy U.S. Savings Bonds Regularly on the Payroll Savings Plan PRM 1-2 Assistance Plans 5 On July 7, 1970, William L. Rodgers advocated for extending the Seed Industry Development Project beyond its March 31, 1972 phase-out due to insufficient achievement in seed research and promotion. He cited personnel and financial constraints, highlighting the need for continued collaboration with Mississippi State University. An extension until March 31, 1974, is being proposed for additional impact on agricultural research."

Cocoa Zone  The drafting officer, Vice Consul Raymond Collins^and BPAO  John Mason attended a conference of mayors at Ilheus from  June 28-30. Organized by the young and energetic Mayor of  Ilheus, Nerival Barros (ARENA), the conference attracted most  of the mayors in the cocoa zone as well as Governor Luis  Viana Filho, State Secretaries of the Interior and Municipal­ ities and representatives of SUDENE, SUDEPE, SESP, BNH, SAAE,  SERFHAU, DERBA etc. The cocoa zone is located on the south­ ern litoral of Bahia and maintains a population in excess of  1,000,000. Though cocoa has long been Bahia's leading ex­ port, the wealth accumulated through its cultivation and in­ dustrialization has not filtered down to the people living  in the area.  The purpose of the conference was to focus attention on the  technical and social needs of the cocoa zone and to formu­ late comprehensive regional planning fully integrated with  state and federal development schemes. At the conclusion  of the conference a loose organization called the ^Alliance  of Mayors in the Reconcavo\" was formed. It will be/respon­ sibility of this group to undertake an inventory of the re­ gion's most pressing needs, draw up specific projects in  such fields as health, education, housing, communications  and power and channel these projects to an appropriate state,  federal or international agency for consideration.

His mission was strictly religious —  to establish contaet with the church — and he went as the  personal emissary of Pope Paul. Dom Eugenio confided that  Foreign Minister MagalhSes Pinto asked him to keep his eyes  and ears open during the visit as he was deeply concerned  about Cuban guerrilla activity spreading to the South Amer­ ican continent.  Dom Euge\"nio said he returned from Cuba with the profound con­ viction that \"it could happen here\". He said if the Brazilian  sugar barons and owner-bosses (proprietaries) were able to  witness the results of the Cuban revolution, they would in  self interest force higher wages and better living conditions  on their workers. The situation in Brazil cannot remain as  it is, he added, it is of the utmost urgency that the insen­ sibilities of the ruling class to existing social injustices  be overcome. He said the Brazilian people are very patient  and violence is contrary to their nature, but the pressures  of the world in which they live will make them susceptible  to radical political change. The reporting officer referred  to the noticeable growth of a sizeable middle class in the  central and southern parts of Brazil and asked if he thought  the progress the Northeast is now making might not stave off  l_ J  UNCLASSIFIED  D5-323 FOR^ggpT.

The memorandum is an interesting sidelight to the controversy  between the Catholic Church and the administration (Ref Airgrams).  Bishop Sales' statement that the situation has been \"improved, but not  resolved,\" is almost certainly correct. It is significant that he  feels \"none\" of the Bishops supports those seminarians who were in­ volved in the distribution of anti-administration pamphlets in Yolta  Redonda. Bishop Sales was probably selected by the President as  a mediator in the Church-State problem because of his liberal, but  responsible, reputation and his position of respect in both Church  and government circles.

John net with various aeshers of the U.S. Mission  bare concerning possible Title IX projects. One of the possibilities we  discussed was a proposal which we have been considering for some time for  the training of foreign priests sad other clergymen, particularly Americans.  We have observed with considerable interest, end at times concern, the weak  of various religious groups in the northeast and elsewhere in Brazil as  promoters of social change. Foreign priests, and churchmen of otter  denominations, have been active in a wide variety of organizations working  toward modernization. In this regard, the work being done with cooperatives  and trade unions, and in the fields of health, leadership and literacy  training, and community development are particularly noteworthy.

Frequent failure ami  mounting frustration are the inevitable result. The voluntary expulsion  of the two American Oblate priests in Lata December of lest year may be  attributed in part to such factors. AGR 5-3 Youth Clubs The letter discusses Mr. John Schott‘s recent visit to Recife to explore potential Title IX projects focused on training foreign priests and clergymen. It highlights the role of religious groups in promoting social change in Brazil, particularly in cooperatives and community development. However, many priests are ill-prepared for these challenges, leading to frustrations and failures, including the expulsion of two American Oblate priests."

The rate will be raised to 16 percent starting  April 1, 1968, to 17 percent effective May 1, 1968, and to a full 18 percent  as of June 1, 1968. Agricultural products will not be subject to any tax  increases.  According to Governor Sodr6, the ICM tax rise will take place not  only in Sao Paulo, but will be adopted uniformly by all the states of  Central-South Brazil. This measure was authorized by Federal Minister  Antonio DELFIM NETO following the November 9, 1967 meeting of the  Secretaries of Finance of all the states of Brazil (see A-148 of  November 9, 1967).  The gradual increase in the state ICM rate to become effective in  April, 1968, rather than in January is aimed at avoiding an additional  inflationary impact on prices to consumers at a time when the increase  as of January 1, 1968, of the federal tax on Industrialized Products-IPM- (a form of excise tax) on several products is liable to influence prices  upward.  The increase in the rate of the ICM to 18 percent will provide significant additional revenue to the state government assuming no adverse impact on business as forecast by the Sao Paulo Federation of Industries.

The rise is expected to boost state revenue significantly."

Copies already have been forwarded  to the Population Officers.  The book has been the object of praise and blame. It is certainly- controversial, and for that very reason we believe that you will find  it provocative and stimulating. Its message may be stated simply  \"Unless current world trends in population growth and industrial  output are checked, and unless pollution is severely curbed, civili­ zation faces a catastrophic collapse within 100 years and perhaps  within 50\". In the words of the Science review, the book is a \"hard  sell for a computer view of doomsday\".  The Chief of TA/AGR's Economic Division has the following comments on  the book:  \"This report is a representative example of a beginning  effort leading to better understanding of the complex  interrelationships between five basic factors: population,  agricultural production, natural resources, industrial  production, and pollution. The global modeling effort  provides for ordering a set of assumptions and corrective  hypotheses for complex systems. As the authors frankly  state, the model is as yet imperfect and much further  study is needed and planned.  \"Your attention is drawn to this imaginative, and con­ siderably innovative approach to sector analysis, to  conceptual and quantitative issues making such a first  approximation of dynamic modeling possible and to the  initial findings of the range of first approximation  conditions required for achieving a state of global  equilibrium.  \"Serious efforts are underway in some missions with the  Technical Assistance Bureau, assisted by the U. S. University  Community to refine, extend, and elaborate on the sector  approach, outlined in preliminary form in the enclosed  text.\"  Buy U.S. Savings Bonds Regularly on the Payroll Savings Plan  soir-ioe INF4 Inquiries2 On October 26, 1972, the USAID Agriculture Staff received “The Limits of Growth,“ a controversial book discussing potential catastrophic consequences of unchecked population growth and pollution. The memo highlights the book‘s provocative nature and indicates ongoing efforts to refine the sector analysis approach it presents. It emphasizes the need for further research to understand complex interrelationships between population, resources, and industrial production."

A telegram from Rio de Janeiro, dated August 7, 196*, reports on a “Week of Protest“ against high living costs that culminated in a boycott. Initial efforts were deemed unsuccessful, with minimal impact on labor and business. Propaganda targeted favela residents for a mass meeting, though police were prepared to prevent expanding protests. General activity in downtown appeared normal, indicating the boycott‘s ineffectiveness."

Bocmstra  Charge d'affaires a.i.  American Snbassy  Bio de Janeiro, Brazil  Dear Mr. Boonstrai  This letter is sent to you in response to your telegram of  June 19 requesting a statement for use in preparation of my 1970  officer evaluation report. What I have tried to do in the following  in con?)lying with yoiar request is to provide you with a thumbnail  sketch of the Belcaa Consular District, a gemral breakdown of the  purpose of the Cons\\ilate and the responsibilities of the principal  officer and a not-so-brief discussion of efforts taken by nyself  since my arrival to fulfill my responsibilities.  Belem is a two-man post with foiir Brazilian employees responsible  for a consular district measuring 2,000 miles by 1,200 miles. The  district, idiich comprises about hOj^ of the total land ai^ of Brazil,  is coextensive with the Brazilian North ot Amazon area. The region ia  charactexdzed by a sparse and unevenly distributed population (5 mlliion),  a subsistence agriculture and extractive industrial economy and ijranense  couanunication and transportation problems. Long neglected, it has only  been within the last ten years that the Brazilian government has made  a concentrated effoxd to encoxirage develojanent and to begin the inte­ gration of ti^ region into the national economy.  Even so, in spite of current efforts, the area is still of marginal  importance economical].y and politically when compared with other regions  of Brazil and most likely will remain so for the forseeable future. From  a pyschological standpoint, however, Amazonia is of major importance.  It has markedly influenced the Brazilian psyche and the obsession with  the area should continue until such time as it becomes an integral part  of Brazil and the federal government no longer feels that its sovereignty  over the region is threatened.  Residing within the consular district are an estimated 1,?00  American citizens. Many are missionaides, but an ever-increasing number  of U.S. ccmipanies and businesaaen, attracted lyr investment opportunities,  are establishing local operations and taking up residence. Tourist  traffic from the United States, including many adventuroxis young people  travelling on a shoe 8tx*ing, is also growing.  UNCLASSIFIED PER - Personnel On June 26, 1970, a letter was addressed to Clarence A. Boonstra regarding a 1970 officer evaluation report. It outlines the Belem Consular District‘s responsibilities, which covers a vast, sparsely populated area in Brazil. The region, pivotal to Brazil‘s psyche yet economically marginal, is experiencing increased American presence, including missionaries and business interests, amidst ongoing development efforts."

Thanks to positive and imaginative planning and the co- ~~'  operation and coordinated efforts of the DVS, Military Police,  Civil Guard and Army units, the movements and activities of  UNE students were effectively controlled and Belo Horizonte  was spared being subjected to student riots and demonstrations  as was originally feared.  2. However, in spite of police efforts to prevent a meeting,  the students managed to convene a clandestine meeting in the  parish hall of the Franciscan Church in Belo Horizonte, with  the foreknowledge and consent of the Franciscan priests. The  meeting was held on the night of July 28 and early morning  hours of July 29* Some 150 to 200 students were present at  the meeting. The only action reportedly taken by them was to  present a single slate of candidates for the UNE directorate  for next year* The entire slate of candidates was elected by  acclamation by the delegates present. Representatives of the  Communist Party of Brazil (PCB) and Popular Action (AP) were  known to have been present at the meeting. PCB representa­ tives reputedly proposed that the UNE be dissolved to avoid  further conflict between the students and Federal Government.  The majority of the students, led by AP representatives, are  said to have rejected the proposal.  3» 0ut-of«*town students were estimated by police authorities  to have numbered never more than 200 to 250 and only a small  fraction of Belo Horizonte students became identified with or  participated in UNE activities.

Lacerda followers are probably more than ever a minority in  SSo Paulo, but they are a strong and vocal minority tied  closely to the military \"hard-line\" group.

Attached is a memorandum of conversation between Dom Eugenio SALES,  the Bishop of Salvador, and officers of the Consulate in Salvador.  COMMENT  2. The memorandum is an interesting sidelight to the controversy  between the Catholic Church and the administration (Ref Airgrams).  Bishop Sales' statement that the situation has been \"improved, but not  resolved,\" is almost certainly correct. It is significant that he  feels \"none\" of the Bishops supports those seminarians who were in­ volved in the distribution of anti-administration pamphlets in Yolta  Redonda. Bishop Sales was probably selected by the President as  a mediator in the Church-State problem because of his liberal, but  responsible, reputation and his position of respect in both Church  and government circles.

A telegram from the U.S. Embassy in Rio de Janeiro discusses a National Security Council (NSC) analysis of U.S. interests in Brazil. The message critiques the analysis for undervaluing Brazil‘s overall importance, likening it to assessing a balanced diet by evaluating individual nutrients without recognizing their collective significance. It also suggests that the analysis neglects Brazil‘s potential role in key foreign policy issues."

D.C. 20S2O  5 S/S 7120572  RS/R FILES  Attention **  CONFIDENTIAL  0 r MEMORANDUM FOR MR. HENRY A. KISSINGER  COPIEF TO: THE WHITE HOUSE  J  'c,-/pc Subject: Argentine Sensitivities Toward Brazil  n_ Sharply Increase  Argentina is extremely concerned that the United  States may have selected Brazil as its chosen instrument  in dealing with Latin America and that the United States  may be encouraging or permitting Brazil to establish a  form of hegemony over the rest of Latin America. The  long-standing Argentine animosity toward and envy of  Brazil have been sharply exacerbated by the visit of  President Medici of Brazil to Washington and the resultant  press reports suggesting that the U.S. has singled out \"5  Brazil as the most important nation in Latin America. A ^  rash of editorials has broken out in the Argentine press  decrying what they assume to be official U.S. Government y  policy to place Brazil at the head of Latin America. The ^  Medici visit has also triggered off a flurry of rumors s\\  and speculation about a possible U.S. invitation to  Argentine President Lanusse to visit Washington.  Argentine officials have queried Embassy officers  about press statements emanating from Washington during  the visit of the Brazilian president which suggested that  the U.S. Government considers Brazil to be the most  important country in Latin America. In pursuance of their  apprehensions about Argentina's being discarded, senior  Foreign Ministry officials in Buenos Aires have told  United States officials that they believe Argentina has  an important although modest role to play in the Southern  Cone, exercising a moderating influence over countries  such as Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and, to some  extent, Chile.  CONFIDENTIAL MICROFILMED  *«A-U/AT0 -.vif -S.TOIVW.1 BY S/S-I POLITICAL AFFAIRS & RELATIONS The memorandum from the U.S. Department of State expresses Argentina‘s growing concern over the U.S. favoring Brazil in Latin American affairs, particularly after Brazilian President Medici‘s Washington visit. Argentine officials fear being sidelined and have voiced their belief in Argentina‘s significant role in the region. The situation has led to increased tension and negative press in Argentina regarding U.S. policy."

Revised Bank of Brazil accounts indicate that the net foreign asset  position of the Brazilian monetary authorities improved by only $3«9  million during the first semester of 19^7, not $24.1 million as pre­ viously reported. Following relative stability during the first semester  the net foreign asset position deteriorated sharply during July and August  by slightly more than $100 mi Hi or. and weekly estimates show a further  decline of almost $90 million tnrough October 20 as shown in Table I.  2. The deterioration in net foreign assets during July was anticipated  owing to the low level of coffee receipts and the heavy repayments of  suppliers credits and project loans during that month, but August should  have shewn some improvement. The major cause of the deteriorating  foreign exchange position which continued into October has been heavy  speculation against the cruzeiro. This speculation started early in  August and intensified following the implementation of Central Bank  Resolution 62 control on the manual market which was interpreted as a  sign of a low level of exchange reserves (See A-204, August 31* 1967).  3. The exchange speculation took two major forms: early closing of  exchange contracts for imports and financial remittances through In­ struction 289. As importers closed exchange contracts for imports,  the commercial banks obtained the necessary exchange cover from the  Bank of Brazil (agent for the Central Bank). Exchange cover provided  to the \"private banks rose from an average of $7 million per month  earlier in 1967 to $44 million in July, $80 million in August and $124  million in September.

This control is exercised  with the assistance of ARENA'S General Secretary Anibal Khoury and the  use of a system of rewards and punishment to keep politicians in line.  The Governor's popular support does not appear to be as great as that  enjoyed by Senator and ex-Governor Ney Braga who reportedly wants to  be a candidate for governor in 1970. The rift between Pimentel and Braga  continues to exist and some observers are speculating that Pimentel will  try to keep Braga from getting his name on the ballot.  Introduction  In a separate report (see Sao Paulo's A-426) concerning the November 15,  1968, elections in Parana, the firm control of Governor Paulo Pimentel  and ARENA State Secretary Anibal Khoury over the state's ARENA party  organization was mentioned. The present report deals in greater detail  with the Governor's control over the party organization and with extent  of popular support for the Governor's Administration. It also discusses  some of the prospective candidates for governor of Parana in 1970 and  Pimentel's ambitions.  L_ EXEMPT FROM AUTOMATIC DECONTROL  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE J  FOR DEPT. USE ONLY  D5-323 • Out  en/dks October 25, 1968  Clearances: PROVINCIAL, MUNICIPAL & STATE GOVERNMENT On October 25, 1968, a report from São Paulo outlines Governor Paulo Pimentel‘s strong control over Parana‘s ARENA party, aided by General Secretary Anibal Khoury. Although Pimentel‘s influence is significant, his popularity lags behind ex-Governor Ney Braga, who aspires to run for governor in 1970. Tensions between Pimentel and Braga may affect the upcoming candidacy."

The University of Arizona, Mississippi State University, The  Ohio State University, Purdue University and The University of Wisconsin  constitute the founding membership of the COUNCIL. These universities have  major agricultural education and research development programs in Brazil.  For several years, they have been working closely with sister institutions  in Brazil in an attempt to increase the rate at which the latter become  able to better serve the needs of the Brazilian society. Substantive  progress toward this end has been made; much remains to be done before the  Brazilian system of higher education and research in agriculture will be  in position to contribute that which it must to the economic and social  development of that great nation. COUNCIL members are fully committed to  contributing in such ways as they might to this mission.  In a larger sense, there exists an urgent need to create an  international resource in the form of United States education and scientific  competence in matters relevant to Brazilian agriculture. Effectiveness of  action programs in Brazilian rural development has been, is and will continue  to be hampered by a paucity of knowledge about relevant social, economic and  technical forces. Present and near future capacity of the agricultural edu­ cation and research system in Brazil is inadequate to provide the knowledge  requirements necessary to rapid agricultural development, economic growth and  social progress. The systematic development of scholarly centers of excel­ lence treating of these matters within United States universities has the  potential of paying extremely high dividends both in terms of attainment  of Brazilian national goals and in the establishment of long-run, mutually  desirable and acceptable relationships between the United States and Brazil.  In still broader context, United States colleges of agriculture  are faced with the necessity of developing a comprehensive international  dimension to their traditional education and research missions. This neces­ sity grows out of secular growtli in the interdependence, of United States  agriculture and that of the rest of the world and inescapable responsibili­ ties to expand the scientific knowledge base to non-domestic physical, bio­ logical and human behavioral phenomena. It is given additional impetus by  the educational demands of young people and adults desiring careers in  international agriculture or in a domestic agriculture increasingly sensitive  to events abroad.  COUNCIL members desire to strengthen their scientific and educa­ tional capabilities requisite to the completion of developmental tasks abroad. Agricultural University Council The Council of United States Universities for Brazilian Rural Development has been established, comprising the University of Arizona, Mississippi State University, Ohio State University, Purdue University, and the University of Wisconsin. This initiative aims to enhance agricultural education and research in Brazil, addressing barriers to rural development while fostering international collaborations and expanding the role of U.S. agriculture in global contexts."

It appears unlikely  that the MDB will elect a majority either of any state's federal  deputy delegation or in a state legislature. To date, the political  campaign is being carried out on the personalistic and parochial  basis typical of Northeastern Brazilian politics. National issues  are being largely ignored and neither the campaign nor the election  results are expected to produce a test of popular opinion or an  indication of popular will. To the extent that national issues are  being raised, ARENA orators are praising the personality of President  Me*dici and economic gains of the Revolution, while those of the MDB  are urging a return to democracy and full human and civil rights. The  normal Northeast voting patterns are expected to hold, with the  opposition MDB running well in urban centers and ARENA sweeping the  more populous rural areas. The greatest threat to ARENA appears to be  widespread voter indifference in its rural strongholds. As usual,  the Brazilian proportional voting system will considerably blur the  significance of the election results. Even the state-wide senate  results are expected to be ambiguous due to the virtual certainty that  the MDB vote in these races will be swelled by normally ARENA voters  casting their second vote for the MDB due to persisting intra-ARENA  hostilities.

Significant alterations were made in the original  version of the bill as reported in the referenced airgram. The most impor­ tant of these permanently equips the National Monetary Council with a new  fiscal stabilizer. A translation of the bill as passed by the Senate is  attached as an enclosure to this airgram.  In terms of its original import the bill still provides fiscal incen­ tives for stabilization and productivity increase, namely: 1) a reduction  from 28 to 20 percent of the tax rate on 1965 business incomes for firms  both containing their sales price increases over the 10 months ending  December 31, 1965 to within 15 percent over levels verified at the outset  of the period and increasing the quantity of 1965 sales by at least 5  percent over 196k levels and 2) an increase of from 28 to 35 percent of  the tax rate on 1965 business incomes for firms increasing sales prices  by more than 30 percent over the above mentioned period. Note that one  important change from the original version is a redefinition of productivity  iy performance; the original version called upon firms to increase total  nominal receipts by 50 percent over 196k levels rather than quantity sold.  With regard to the fiscal penalty the original version was changed to  exempt firms which do not increase gross profit margins over 196k levels  or which can attribute price increases in excess of 30 percent to exchange  rate movements or increases in primary materials prices charged by \"mixed  entity\" suppliers. /  The most important new provision of the bill is that authorizing  the National Monetary Council to reduce or eliminate the federal excise  UNCLASSIFIED FOR DEPT.

The Governor attacked Federal Administration  policies toward Petrobras on two counts* One was that the salaries  established for Petrobras were too high for Minas Gerais. The second  count dealt with the Federal Government's elimination of subsidies.

A-190, December 19, 1966. DATE: January 16, 1967  The November 15, 1966 direct congressional elections resulted in a  significant turnover in the 59 member Paulista representation in the  Federal Chamber of Deputies. Among SSo Paulo's deputies there will  be 25 newcomers, a change of over 40% in the state's delegation. As  ' the Consulate General has reported (A-190), Arena lost two seats in  November and will send 32 deputies to the new session of the Chamber.  Five Arena incumbents did not run for reelection and eight Arena deputies  who sought another term were defeated. Thus Arena will present eleven  new Paulistas in the Chamber. Among MDB's contingent of 27 deputies,  over half - 14 - are newly elected to Congress. Two opposition deputies  retired and ten were rejected by voters on election day.  Attached are brief political biographies of SSo Paulo's 25 new Chamber  representatives—some of whom are well-known, established S2o Paulo  political figures and others of whom are still relatively unknown, at  least in the state capital. For each new deputy the Consulate General  has attempted to supply information on political attitudes and for most  of them some sort of projection has been hazarded on their possible  posture in the next Congress. However, as many Brazilian politicians  in the past have shown extreme flexibility, it is conceivable that formerly- held sentiments and old allegiances may not necessarily be infallible in­ dications as to future behavior. It is entirely possible, then, that in  some cases the rough political evaluations offered below may be far off  the mark as predictions of the conduct of new Paulista deputies in Congress,  l_ J  23 CONFIDENTIAL  LW.eIf .\"Wig^Tr\".Appr FOR DKPT.
