The paper pictured the Brazilian events as being a struggle between the  left and the right which is \"far from finished\". It said that there was  no doubt that \"Goulart enjoyed considerable popular support\" but it added  (rather surprisingly in view of traditional condemnation of any relatively  pro-Western revolutionary activity) that \"the forces of capitalism, and  with them a large section of the military and of the intelligentsia, see  in the American way of life an example worthy of emulation.

The referenced airgram reported the submission to the  military court system of the results-of the Police-Military  Inquiry (IFM) Into the pro-Goulart radio programs broadcast in  Brasilia at the time of the 136H Revolution. The Archbishop  of Brasilia, Dom Jose NEWTON de Admelda, had been included in  the list of those accused by the IPM of infraction o'f the  National Security Lav/, along with the former head of the Civil  Household, Darci Ribeiro, and others.  2. On April 5, the Superior Military Court (SuperiorTribunal  Militar - STM) voted to throw the entire IPM report out of  court. In the words of the reporting justice, Minister Alcides  Carneiro, \"The public prosecutors in Brasilia judged that the  results of the inquiry should be rejected on the grounds of  the absence of any illegal act. In this record, there are no  proofs; so there is no guilt to be determined. The path of  this IPM is to the dust of the archives.\"  3. The decision was taken by a tie vote, automatically broken  in favor of the defendants by the presiding justice, Gen.  Olimpio Mourao Filho. The Attorney-General for Military  Justice, however, in his opinion to the court, had recommended  that the Archbishop be excluded from the IPM and that the  process be handed down to the military court of the 4th  Military Region in Juiz de Fora for prosecution of the other  defendants. Presumably, those on the court who voted against '.  the complete rejection of the IPM results nonetheless supported  the Attorney-General's opinion absolving the Archbishop.

Ludwig,  never a man to plan on a small scale,  has a monumental new gamble going  in Brazil's Amazon basin. In the last  four years he has sown more than $30- million into a vast commercial refores­ tation scheme on a 2.4-million acre  tract. Ultimately he will put at least  $60-million into his huge tree farm, but  already the 74-year-old U. S. tycoon has  become the biggest investor in one of  the world's last frontiers.  Ludwig is taking a plunge into a  realm of tropical agriculture never be­ fore attempted on such a scale.  And the scheme, operating under  the shroud of secrecy that is a  Ludwig trademark, has Brazil­ ians fascinated. \"The project is so  grandiose that you would expect  it only from a national govern­ ment,\" says an American diplo­ mat in Brazil. \"Ludwig is accus­ tomed to investing in lunatic  adventures, and just as accus­ tomed to having them pay off,\"  says noted Brazilian economist  Roberto Campos.  Ludwig moves with the bold­ ness of a Howard Hughes and  owns more shipping tonnage  than Aristotle Onassis. Now he  looks for his gigantic jungle proj­ ect to produce 5-million cu. yd. of  lumber by 1986. Production,  mainly for export to the U. S. and  Europe, will begin in 1977.  Having built a fortune in such  varied fields as shipping, savings  and loan associations, hotels, real  estate, mining, and petrochem­ icals, Ludwig dreamed for years  of harvesting equatorial forests  for timber. He had first picked  Nigeria for his site, but a meet­ ing in the early 1960s with Ro­ berto Campos, then ambassador  to Washington, made him set his  course for the Amazon. Campos  became Brazil's chief economic  planner in 1964 and took Ludwig  to see then-President Humberto  Castello Branco, who gave the  project his blessing.  Wood futures. Ludwig believes  that the world is outstripping its  pulp and wood supplies, and that  the traditional source in forests  BUSINESS WEEK: July 31, 1971 of Northern spruce cannot last. He is  betting that the new source will be  equatorial forests, but the secret of  success must be uniform trees.  The tree that Ludwig has picked to  fill the bill is the Gmelina arborea, an  Asian species, also grown in Africa.  The fast-growing, medium-density  hardwood is suitable for furniture, ve­ neer, matches, construction, and—most  importantly—for wood pulp.  Ludwig got his project moving in  March, 1967, when he took over Jari'  Florestal e Agropecuaria (Jarf For- V A /  Surinam V Guiana' Daniel Ludwig's supersize tree farm  sot i c Oc< •  Soulh  America  \\__Guyana /  / ) (French  i /  / / L ^> % W  r' y> AmaPa  9> T a z / /  Am* Para  Ludwig's tract Beletll  9 .

Jari' then proceeded to buy up land in  the state of Para and the territory of  Amapa on the Jari' River, 250 mi. from  the port city of Belem.  At the site, called Monte Dourado,  900 Ludwig employees have planted  61,000 acres of seedlings this year.  They have built more than 100 mi. of  all-weather road to clearings where  sawmills and pulp mills will rise and  where an eventual 2,000 workers will  be housed.  In a mist. A thick fog of secrecy  has settled over Monte Dourado.  The Jari' office in Rio is not listed  in the lobby directory and has no  sign on its door. And Jari oper­ ations are veiled, in turn, behind  another Ludwig front called  Entre Rios Comercio e Adminis- tracao.  These secretive methods upset  some Brazilians. \"I just can't un­ derstand all this secrecy,\" com­ plains an official of Brazil's Ama­ zon Development Agency. But  Brazil is letting Ludwig have his  way because it wants the Ama­ zon basin opened up.  Ludwig has run into other  problems, though. During last  year's rainy season, floods swept  away some 4-million seedlings. In  the dry season, so much rain fell  that it delayed planting. And, in  some respects, the Gmelina's  growth has been disappointing.  In Brazilian soil, it tends to  sprout branches too low, making  its lumber too knotty.  But Ludwig expected prob­ lems, and he has not been dis­ mayed by the century-long  record of failures in the Amazon.  Greening. Contrary to popular be­ lief, jungle soil is extremely frag­ ile. Its nutrients are leached out  by heavy rains, and cleared ter­ rain can quickly erode into a  rocklike shale. Ludwig must dis­ cover what can be done with such  soil on a large scale. So far, the  Gmelina has been growing to a  phenomenal 15 ft. to 18 ft. in only  18 months. But the crucial an­ swers will only begin to come in  BUSINESS ABROAD AGR 8 Forestry2 Daniel K. Ludwig is investing over $30 million in a large-scale reforestation project in Brazil‘s Amazon, targeting a total of $60 million. He aims to cultivate the Gmelina arborea tree for lumber and wood pulp by 1986. Ludwig‘s venture has drawn attention for its secrecy and scale, with operations facing challenges like flooding and soil issues."

When SUDENE's 34/18 program of investment incentives  for private industry first began to take hold a few  years ago, many of the states entered into competition  with each other by offering supplementary incentives,  tax exemptions, special financing or industrial sites  at nominal cost in order to attract new industries to  their cities. The states later agreed that such  competition was divisive and hindered the development  of the region as a whole. They further agreed to  standardize state government assistance to new industry  to the extent possible.  2. This phase of cooperation, of pulling together for  the benefit of the region as a whole is probably best  illustrated by the following example: At a SUDENE  Deliberative Council meeting in November, 1967, the  Aluminum Co. of Canada requested permission of the  Council to relocate from Pernambuco to Bahia its  already approved project for an aluminum extrusion  plant. The Governor of Pernambuco complained to the  Council that he saw no need for the change but, he  recommended that in the interest of overall regional  development the Council should approve the request in  order to allow investors free choice of location and  thereby make the region more attractive to private  investment. This attitude of regional cooperation and  harmony was further strengthened by attacks on the  UNCLASSIFIED For Department Use Only  - 3 . 1 \\J - OH - I-:-'- e : c ' •  FRCampbell/lm /&n Drafting Date:  9/6/I968 Phone No.: Contents and Classification hff  JRFalzone V XT  C esrances:  AmEmbassy, Rio: RJBloomfield, ECON J  * U.

These publications should help to keep the Mission  abreast of the progress and problems of the U, S. economy, and also be use­ ful in gauging and improving the competitive U, S. performance in world  markets. The Outlook provides detailed analyses of over 100 manufacturing  and service industries, describing new products and effects of new technolo­ gies, as well as international trade and defense-related regulations within  the industries.  in Its transactions with foreign countries, the American economy, as you  'fctioV, achieved mixed results in 1968, The overall balance of payments  so's^tion greatly improved over the 1967 deficit, but U.

In group conversations the following came  to light: Prior to Manaus (his second post), he was assigned to Arauca.  Colombia on the Venezuelan Border for five years. There is not much  legitimate trade between his consular district and Venezeula and few  if any Venezuelan citizens residing in Amazonas, Roraima, Rondonia  and Acre, the states and territories that coagjrise his district.  Accordingly, his consular work must consist of issuiga few visas for  the weekly Varig flight to Caraczo.

Marshall Whitlock, out Consular Agent, states he does quite a  bit of driving as she had brought several sets of tires from Marshall's  firm since his arrival.SIKHHDBKGmffil^^ Unless he spends a lot of  time driving around Manaus the only other possibilities would be  the 286 kilometers betwe«i Manaus and Itacoatiara on the Amazon River,  an 8 hour trip during the dry season, or the few kilometers of the  BR-17ii in sae towards the Alalau River on the Roraima Border, or he  mi^t even be buying tires at a diplomatic price for friends.

By the way, Belem still is not receiving info copies on the Guyana- Venezuela traffice. Is there anything you can do?  CONFIDMTIAL POL 6 On January 8, 1970, William Balicer, stationed in Manaus, described Venezuelan Consul Leopoldo Taylhardat as a sociable figure who previously worked on the Colombian border. Balicer noted the lack of trade between territories in his consulate district and the absence of Venezuelan citizens there. He expressed curiosity about Taylhardat‘s activities and sought assistance with communication issues concerning Guyana-Venezuela traffic."

Approximately 1500 rural workers are participating  in the strike which, at this writing, still continues without  promise of settlement.  2. At issue in the dispute is the failure of the sugar cane  producers to pay the minimum wage scale established by the  Federal government in March 1966. Union officials claim  that virtually none of the state's 120,000 rural workers are  receiving the legal minimum of Cr$l800 per day. Many  employers, it is alleged, have paid no salaries at all for  four or five weeks while others are paying all or part of  the worker's wages in scrip good only at company stores,  many of which have little or no merchandise for sale.

This policy made Brazilian beef  uaare ccsspetitive in the world market and has encouraged farmers to  sell their animals rather than keep them for future herd expansion.  \"Direction of our Agric ult>ire\"  \"In view of rapid population growth and of {growth of our per capita  income, there is an interest in knowing if Brazilian agric at oral  production will be capable of increasing during tee next few .years  sufficiently to keep pace with anticipated demand. Thus, the recent  release by the GoMlio Vargas Foundation of a study which presents  projections of supply and demand for Brazilian agricultural products  to 1975 io very timely.  \"The study was carefully prepared and was based on extensive field  research, Conauiaptim tendencies were based on a survey of Y,J10 'urban  family budgets in different cities fed on 1,359 rural family budgets.  Supply tendencies wore based on a stud:/ of 2,165 farm units located in  Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Caterim, SSo Paulo, Mime Geyais, Espirito  Santo, Beroauibuea, and Gears!  \"The principal conclusion of the study is teat between i960 and 1975  agricultural production will Increase at a lower rate than internal  demand. During these 15 years, production should increase about 75  percent while demand increases about 31 percent. This difference is  not very large, but it is sufficiently large to give cm concern if  one considers that Brasil is one of the countries most abundantly  endowed with agricultural resources. The study recognizes this, but  forecasts teat the growth of cultivated area will be only about 3.5 to  4 percent annually which is leas than tee 4.5 percent annual growth  rate between 1350 and i960. The reason given for this assumption is  that 'in the present stage of Brazilian agricultural development the  expansion of cultivated area, within the existing structure, appears  to be reaching a point of saturation.'  \"According to the study, tee discrepancy between production and demand  for agricultural products should result only in an almost proportional  growth in Imports, Imports which represented 4 percent of domestic  demand for agricultural products in i960 should grew a little more slow­ ly then internal demand, thus representing 3.6 percent in 19Y5« This  indicates teat our self-sufficiency in food should improve a little  through impart substitution.  UNCLASSIFIED AGR2 Agricultural Economics 1 Brazil‘s policy to maintain low beef prices has made Brazilian beef uncompetitive globally, prompting farmers to sell animals instead of expanding herds. A recent study by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation projects that from 1960 to 1975, agricultural production will increase by 75% while demand rises by 31%, raising concerns about food self-sufficiency and imports."

The diploma awarded to Ambassador Gordon was delivered to  him the following morning at his regular staff session and an  appropriate letter of appreciation has been sent. The diploma  awarded to NASA is forwarded as an attachment to this airgram.  Expression of appreciation has already been made informally,  but NASA may wish to acknowledge directly receipt of this  distinction.  /-T~~O7TT>X 3/ \\  I) \\  1 Encl/: v  J  FOR DEPT.

Sorghum, being adapted to drought conditions, might be used to  extend the growing season. ^fUse of hi-lysine corn should be encouraged  as soon as this is available. Demonstrations of this corn, and of  its use as hog and poultry feed should be started now. For the small  farmer who grows corn to feed his family, hi-lysine corn can mean  the difference between adequate and inadequate protein nutrition. - y  3. Bean production.  Bean production is a possibility for those areas with adequate  rainfall and, preferably, conditions of terrain suitable for mechani­ zation. No difficulty should be experienced in timing the harvest to  fall in dry weather.  4. Cashew Nut.  This tree is native to the tropics of Central and South America,  although India has become the most important center of production. The  Cashew offers considerable possibility for development. This tree  produces several products. The cashew \"apple\" is not a true fruit, but  is the swollen peduncle. The true fruit is the kidney-shaped structure  attached to this. The kernel extracted from this is the cashew nut of  commerce. The nut shell has two walls separated by a honeycomb structure  containing a liquid, having an irritant effect on the skin, which is  known as Cashew Nut Shell Liquid. This material is an important source  of natural phenols and is used in the preparation of lubricants, insecti­ cides, plastics, electrical insulation varnishes, and a bonding agent  for brake linings. The cashew \"apple\" may be eaten fresh or as preserves  and is used for juice.  2.

Ludwig,  never a man to plan on a small scale,  has a monumental new gamble going  in Brazil's Amazon basin. In the last  four years he has sown more than $30- million into a vast commercial refores­ tation scheme on a 2.4-million acre  tract. Ultimately he will put at least  $60-million into his huge tree farm, but  already the 74-year-old U. S. tycoon has  become the biggest investor in one of  the world's last frontiers.  Ludwig is taking a plunge into a  realm of tropical agriculture never be­ fore attempted on such a scale.  And the scheme, operating under  the shroud of secrecy that is a  Ludwig trademark, has Brazil­ ians fascinated. \"The project is so  grandiose that you would expect  it only from a national govern­ ment,\" says an American diplo­ mat in Brazil. \"Ludwig is accus­ tomed to investing in lunatic  adventures, and just as accus­ tomed to having them pay off,\"  says noted Brazilian economist  Roberto Campos.  Ludwig moves with the bold­ ness of a Howard Hughes and  owns more shipping tonnage  than Aristotle Onassis. Now he  looks for his gigantic jungle proj­ ect to produce 5-million cu. yd. of  lumber by 1986. Production,  mainly for export to the U. S. and  Europe, will begin in 1977.  Having built a fortune in such  varied fields as shipping, savings  and loan associations, hotels, real  estate, mining, and petrochem­ icals, Ludwig dreamed for years  of harvesting equatorial forests  for timber. He had first picked  Nigeria for his site, but a meet­ ing in the early 1960s with Ro­ berto Campos, then ambassador  to Washington, made him set his  course for the Amazon. Campos  became Brazil's chief economic  planner in 1964 and took Ludwig  to see then-President Humberto  Castello Branco, who gave the  project his blessing.  Wood futures.

The tree that Ludwig has picked to  fill the bill is the Gmelina arborea, an  Asian species, also grown in Africa.  The fast-growing, medium-density  hardwood is suitable for furniture, ve­ neer, matches, construction, and—most  importantly—for wood pulp.

These secretive methods upset  some Brazilians. \"I just can't un­ derstand all this secrecy,\" com­ plains an official of Brazil's Ama­ zon Development Agency. But  Brazil is letting Ludwig have his  way because it wants the Ama­ zon basin opened up.  Ludwig has run into other  problems, though. During last  year's rainy season, floods swept  away some 4-million seedlings. In  the dry season, so much rain fell  that it delayed planting. And, in  some respects, the Gmelina's  growth has been disappointing.  In Brazilian soil, it tends to  sprout branches too low, making  its lumber too knotty.

Significance of current and potential exploitation of marine  resources to the economy of Brazil.  Brazil has an average deficit of some 15 grams of animal protein per  capita per diem. The cheapest animal protein sources are sardine and hake  (Cr$128 and Cr$224, respectively, against Cr$275 for milk - these being the  prices of a complete daily ration of animal protein). Sardine and hake are  plentiful in the South, where the protein deficiency is almost nil, and non­ existent in the North, where the protein deficiency is critical. However,  the North is rich in lobster, red snapper, groupers, shrimp. With the US$ 3  obtained by the export of each kilo of lobster to the U.S., Europe or South  Brazil, the North could import eleven (11) kilos of hake from the South,  paying high trucking freight, or about 15 kilos by maritime freight.  Producing fish in the South to send to the North and producing fish in the  North to send to the South could help Brazil solve the food problem.

Furthermore, I feel strongly that  the memorandum dismisses the ARA case far too lightly.  We have over a period of years attempted to  standardize on Fletcher class destroyers in the major  South American navies. These navies have made their  ' ^ long-range plans in anticipation of eventual ship loan  \\ ' legislation, and such legislation offers them the only 01  reasonable hope of a modest upgrading of their aging  fleets. Brazil is the outstanding example in this  regard, and Ambassador Gordon has put the case forcefully  in Rio telegram 2441 (attached). Indeed, when the  Bra^rttah Foreign Minister called on Secretary Rusk on  April 2, 1965, the ship loan legislation was one of the  items he raised as being of particular importance to his  country8  I would add that, should the ARA bill not pass  while either or both of the others do, the reaction in  South America would be extremely adverse. In the case of  Brazil, which has cooperated with the United States in  an outstanding manner with respect to the Dominican crisis  and the creation of the Inter-American Force, it would be  especially serious.  We V3)  1  r  t5  SECRET DEF 19-8 US-BRAZ On June 9, 1965, Mr. Kitchen expressed concerns about prioritizing ship loan legislation, urging Secretary Rusk to support all three bills. He emphasized the importance of the ARA case, highlighting Brazil‘s reliance on such legislation for fleet upgrades and the potential negative reaction in South America if the ARA bill fails, particularly given Brazil‘s cooperation with the U.S. during the Dominican crisis."

Daring the  extended pericd of several years that the American Embassy protected  Brazilian interests, the Soviets adamantly refused to release a single  repatriate.  Murillo attributes his Embassy's success to a Soviet desire to  start off on the righ+foot in the period immediately following the  establishment of diplomatic relations. While'pleased with the progress  made so far, Murillo ia not particularly sanguine about the future  since, as he says, \"the going gets tougher with each and every case.\"  At the present time there are over two thousand additional cases awaiting  Soviet documentation. \"  One of the more compassionate cases which the Brazilians were able  to bring to a happy conclusion was the Zhilis family. While looking out  for Brazilian interests, this Embassy built up an extensive file on this  family, but we were never able to make the slightest dent with the  Soviet authorities when it came to the question of exit documentation.  After extensive and prolonged maneuvering, the Brazilians were finally  able to secure exit visas for the entire family and they departed Moscow  for Rio De Janeiro on April 2b, 1963.

Department's A-58, August 12, 1963  SUMMARY FILE  No Action  ARA:LA/BR  R. Burton  JAN 7 1964 The Embassy's view is that the Catholic  Church's limited ability to influence Brazilian  public opinion make it but a marginal factor at  the present time in the debate over reform. It  of course has great potential for good; but, like  other Brazilian institutions, especially political  entities, It is weakened by discord and inertia. *******  Despite the fact that Brazil is the largest Catholic nation  in the world, the role of the Church in Brazilian life has  always been rather circumscribed. Its present position in the  nation is reflected in the rather nominal Catholicism of the  large majority of Brazilians, which leads a prominent Catholic  layman to estimate that 5$ of the Brazilian population are  practicing Catholics and another 5$ attend Church on occasion;  the limited numbers of priests within the country (estimated at  less than one for every 40,000 Brazilians); and the inauspicious  showing of a Church-selected and backed slate of candidates in  the 19o2 Guanabara elections. In effect, the Church today  remains more of a veto group, able to block such legislation as  the adoption of legalized divorce, rather than an active  political force. Nevertheless, two factions within the Church,  one extremely nationalistic and useful to if not openly  cooperating with the far left, and the other moderate and reform- oriented, are coming to play an increasingly important  political role.  •-GROUP 3 - Downgrade after 12-yrs;  net automatically declas^j^^  FO  4 - S2 FOR, DEPT.

Rural workers in the Recife suburb of Cabo refused to  report to work on December 13 in an attempt to force their  employers to pay them back wages averaging to Cr$90,000 per  worker.. Approximately 1500 rural workers are participating  in the strike which, at this writing, still continues without  promise of settlement.  2. At issue in the dispute is the failure of the sugar cane  producers to pay the minimum wage scale established by the  Federal government in March 1966. Union officials claim  that virtually none of the state's 120,000 rural workers are  receiving the legal minimum of Cr$l800 per day. Many  employers, it is alleged, have paid no salaries at all for  four or five weeks while others are paying all or part of  the worker's wages in scrip good only at company stores,  many of which have little or no merchandise for sale.

OPTIONAL FORM NO. 10  MAY 1962 EDITION  GSA FPMR (41 CFR) 101-11.6  UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL  Memorandum FILE COPY C3. j^^s  TO : William L. Rodgers, Chief, ARDO  FROM : Russell Desrosiers, Agr. Prod. Advisor  SUBJECT: Possible agricultural projects for Northeast. DATE: October 31, 1969  * 1 • Seed production.  X The production of disease-free,,seed is an industry that can be  developed in the Northeast on semi-arid lands where irrigation is  available. Seed for use throughout the country, and for export,  could be produced. The advantage of the area for this purpose is  that, with high temperature and little or no rainfall, many diseases  which otherwise might prosper and be carried in or on the seed to  infect future crop would not appear at all. Associated business of  seed processing, storage and shipment would develop.  2. Corn and sorghum growing.  Sorghum, being adapted to drought conditions, might be used to  extend the growing season. ^fUse of hi-lysine corn should be encouraged  as soon as this is available. Demonstrations of this corn, and of  its use as hog and poultry feed should be started now. For the small  farmer who grows corn to feed his family, hi-lysine corn can mean  the difference between adequate and inadequate protein nutrition. - y  3. Bean production.  Bean production is a possibility for those areas with adequate  rainfall and, preferably, conditions of terrain suitable for mechani­ zation. No difficulty should be experienced in timing the harvest to  fall in dry weather.  4. Cashew Nut.  This tree is native to the tropics of Central and South America,  although India has become the most important center of production. The  Cashew offers considerable possibility for development. This tree  produces several products. The cashew \"apple\" is not a true fruit, but  is the swollen peduncle. The true fruit is the kidney-shaped structure  attached to this. The kernel extracted from this is the cashew nut of  commerce. The nut shell has two walls separated by a honeycomb structure  containing a liquid, having an irritant effect on the skin, which is  known as Cashew Nut Shell Liquid. This material is an important source  of natural phenols and is used in the preparation of lubricants, insecti­ cides, plastics, electrical insulation varnishes, and a bonding agent  for brake linings. The cashew \"apple\" may be eaten fresh or as preserves  and is used for juice.  2.  Buy U.S. Savings Bonds Regularly on the Payroll Savings Plan AGR NE AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM General Correspondence The memo discusses potential agricultural projects for Northeast U.S. It highlights seed production on semi-arid land, emphasizes drought-resistant corn and sorghum, and suggests bean cultivation where rainfall permits. Additionally, it proposes developing the cashew nut industry, noting its diverse products and commercial uses, including food and industrial applications. The document underscores the region‘s agricultural opportunities."

I. Subregional Groups  The paragraph on subregional groups, as finally agreed,  is Chapter I, paragraph 2.d., of the \"Declaration of  the Presidents of America.\" This reads as follows:  To promote the conclusion of temporary subregional  agreements, with provision for reducing tariffs  within the subregions and harmonizing treatments  toward third nations more rapidly than in the  general agreements, in keeping with the objectives  of regional integration. Subregional tariff  reductions will not be extended to countries that  are not parties to the subregional agreement, nor  will they create special obligations for them.  LTMTTF.D OFFTCT AT. ITSF.

These publications should help to keep the Mission  abreast of the progress and problems of the U, S. economy, and also be use­ ful in gauging and improving the competitive U, S. performance in world  markets. The Outlook provides detailed analyses of over 100 manufacturing  and service industries, describing new products and effects of new technolo­ gies, as well as international trade and defense-related regulations within  the industries.  in Its transactions with foreign countries, the American economy, as you  'fctioV, achieved mixed results in 1968, The overall balance of payments  so's^tion greatly improved over the 1967 deficit, but U.

Advisor  Loan Program for Dairy Cattle Improvement.  Following is historical information related to dairy cattle programs in  Brazil plus my thoughts on how outside financing might be benifical in  improving these programs.  I. NUMBER OF DAIRY CATTLE, CONCENT RATION. PRODUCTION  The Ministry of Agriculture estimated Brazil's cattle population at 88  million head as of December 31, 1967. Other Ministry figures indicate  that the National Dairy Herd was composed of 20.000.000 head in 1963,  of which 5.500.000 head were in lactation. The relatively high number  of head considered as making up the dairy herd may have been arrived at  by considering any bovine milked at some time during the year as being  a part of the dairy herd. The Ministry's estimates show that 30% of  the total herd is composed of cows. This would be roughly 25 million  head, and if as the Ministry figures indicate, 20 million head make up  the dairy herd, one of these figures is obviously incorrect. In the  absence of accurate data on the number of cattle in the national dairy  herd, it would seem that almost any estimate would be reasonable.  Perhaps 10 million head would be a good figure for what are considered  dairy cattle.  Most of what can be considered milk cows are located in the states of  Mines Gerais, Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. In 1966 the amount of  milk produced in these states was respectively 2.040.292, 1.429.800, and  528.299 tons. Total cattle numbers were 19.500.000, 11.300.000, and  II. 200.000 head respectively. These figures indicate that Sao Paulo has  either the greatest number of dairy cows or the highest productivity, or  both, with Mines following. Rio Grande do Sul apparently has a high  percentage of cattle \"not for milk\" in its herd.  II. LOSSES FROM TUBERCULOSIS  There is little information available on incidence of tuberculosis in  either beef or dairy cattle herds. In a 1965 survey of 5 dairy coopera­ tives located in Minas Gerais, PLANAM (Piano de Me1horamento da Alimen- ta?2o e do Manejo do Gado Leiteiro) found that among 9 77 dairy producers,  400 of which were contacted in the survey, only 11% were testing for  tuberculosis. Only 19% were testing for brucelosis.  2 AGR 10-2 Disease and Pests 1 On September 12, 1969, Michael N. Galli discussed the dairy cattle program in Brazil, noting an estimated cattle population of 88 million and a dairy herd of around 20 million. Most dairy cattle are in Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul. He highlighted the lack of data on tuberculosis incidence, with only 11% of dairy producers testing for it."

Comment: This is the second year in a row that Recife has  suffered heavily from rains and floods. Unusually heavy  rainfall, combined with the almost insupperable drainage  problems presented by the city's location at sea level (and,  at times, below sea level), were certainly at the root of  the city's problems, but the loss of life and home was caused  solely by perilous and insalubrious location of mucambos  (shanties) on hillsides and on the edges of the rivers and  swamps.  B. Special SUDENE Council Meeting Declares \"State of Public  Calami tv\"  3. Recife and its suburbs of Olinda, Jaboatao, and Cabo, as  well as Salvador and Santo Amaro, Bahia, were declared by  the SUDENE Deliberative Council to be areas of \"public calamity\"  in a special meeting held behind closed doors. Relief work  was to be supervised by Minister of Coordination Cordeiro de  Farias who arrived in Salvador on June 1 and was expected in  Recife before the end of the week.  4. Comment: Effective coordination among the various private  and public relief agencies proved difficult to achieve. Only  on May 31, four days after the beginning of the intense rains,  were specific responsibilities assigned. Work was further  hampered by inadequate spending authority. The US government  responded to appeals for assistance by providing one ton of  charque (dried meat), 2,000 cotton blankets and 2,600 bars of  soap and authorizing the use of Food for Peace stocks for  emergency feeding.  C. June Meeting of SUDENE Deliberative Council  5.

Stixrud, USNR, the Embassy contacted  Comandante Paulo de Castro Moreira da Silva, one of Brazil's foremost  oceanographers regarding the desired information, who offered the following  statements:  a. Significance of current and potential exploitation of marine  resources to the economy of Brazil.  Brazil has an average deficit of some 15 grams of animal protein per  capita per diem. The cheapest animal protein sources are sardine and hake  (Cr$128 and Cr$224, respectively, against Cr$275 for milk - these being the  prices of a complete daily ration of animal protein). Sardine and hake are  plentiful in the South, where the protein deficiency is almost nil, and non­ existent in the North, where the protein deficiency is critical. However,  the North is rich in lobster, red snapper, groupers, shrimp. With the US$ 3  obtained by the export of each kilo of lobster to the U.S., Europe or South  Brazil, the North could import eleven (11) kilos of hake from the South,  paying high trucking freight, or about 15 kilos by maritime freight.  Producing fish in the South to send to the North and producing fish in the  North to send to the South could help Brazil solve the food problem. This  requires:  (1) Research - oce'anographical and fishery - north and south,  (2) Better hydrography (to improve navigation routes).  In addition, the exploitation of generalized upwelling of cold water along  the southern coast could possibly provide abundant cooling water for  UNCLASSIFIED  DS-323 FOR PEPT.

Speaking at the Political Reporters's Club in Rio de Janeiro  on September 2, Viana said it is of vital importance to create  a climate of understanding which will isolate radicalism and  permit a marshalling of forces for the solution of national  problems. He said an erroneous impression exists in Brazil  that the country is standing still, accomplishing nothing,  whereas the Federal and State Governments are making steady- progress. Viana commented that the economic situation is good  and the fight against inflation has brought appreciable re­ sults, but wide-spread discontent continues to exist because  the political machine is out of kilter. Political crisis is  in the atmosphere, he continued, and an effort must be made  towards establishing national unity, i.e., pacification. Na­ tional discussion of the Strategic Development Plan for Brazil  would help towards a better public understanding of what the  government is doing, he concluded.  The Consulate has been informed that Governor Viana recently  sent a letter to President Costa e Silva in which he attempts  to revive his pacification program. Though given only in  broad outline, the Governor's proposal is nevertheless better  articulated than heretofore. His main theme involves the for­ mation of a National Governors Front which would launch a mas- l_sive publicity campaign to distract the attention of the Bra- j  LIMITED OFFICIAL USE  DS-323 FOR QEPT.

The sessions  recieved no local press or radio coverage because of what was considered  to be an unjustified attack on Govenor Celso Ramos as a fascist and  because of the leftist point of view expressed by some student leaders  and by visiting Federal Deputies Neiva Moreira and Leonel Brizola.  The deputies preached revolution. The impact was limited to the audience  and this varied from the students' mild enthusiasim to the workers' hard  working claque. End Summary  A meeting of student leaders representing Brazil's university  student organizations affliated with the National Student Union met  in Florianopolis from January 5 to 1Z. The conference was well  advertized by a full page spread in the local newspaper \"A Gazeta\"  and by leaflets. Both also publicized the fact that Deputies Leonel  Brizola, Paulo de Tarso, Max da Costa Santos and Neiva Moreira  would not only attend but would also address the meetings. Leaflets  also issued by the Peoples-Workers-Student Front invited the  population to go to the airport to meet Brizola and offered transportation  in special buses. The public was also invited to attend the plenary  sessions held at night in the Law School.

Unfortunately, the Consulate does iK>t have  professional courier semrice and we just recently received the  request for a report covering this period. I believe that our  regular political and economic reporting will have kept you in  touch with day-to-day happenings on the Northern labor scene.  However, there follows a summary of events for the last six months  which, while late, I hope will still be of service to your office.  The early months of the year, until the overthrow of the Goulart  regimd, were marked by increased leftist union agitation as the local  CGT parroted the national program of more and more nationalizations  of private enteirprise and support for Goulart. There is no doubt  that the local CGT and such leftist-d<Mainat^ unions as PETROBRAS and  the dock workers were buoyed up by national events and led to sponsor  more aggressive leftist demands on the local level. These included  a proposed mass meeting to be personally addressed by President Goulart  for sometime in April (styled after the !4arch 13 Rio de Janeiro rally)  and demands for the nationalization of such local industries as ICOMI  (Con A-U8, llarch 2U, 196U) and the Credit Bank of Amazonia (where  majority interest is already controlled by the Brazilian Government).  The Revolution of April 1 brought to a sharp halt all such  agitation. The actual number of Para labor leaders removed from  leadership in local unions (probably no mre than 20) was small.  But it was this leftist faction which represented the vocal and  active element in Para unionism. Their departure left a virtual  vaccuum in this area which the \"democratic\" labor movement seems  presently incapable of filling. Thus, from the point of view of at  least political activity, the alrea<fy weak arvi dependent Northern  Brazil labor movement is now considered even weaker.  Herbert W. Baker,^Esquire^  Labor Attache^  American Embassy^  Rio de Janeiro,  UNCLASSIFIED LAB Labor&Manpower On June 26, 196ii, an American consulate letter addressed to Herbert discusses delays in sending a labor summary due to the lack of courier services. It highlights increased leftist union activity prior to the overthrow of Goulart, marked by demands for nationalization. Following the April 1 revolution, leftist leaders were removed, leaving the Northern Brazil labor movement weaker and less politically active."

The study has been submitted to  President Garrastazu Medici of Brazil, the United Nations  Human Rights Commission, the Brazilian ^Ambassador to Great  Britain, the Secretary General of the United Nations, and—  jointly with the Latin America Department of the National  Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. and the Division for  Latin America of the United States Catholic Conference—to the  Human Rights Commission of the Organization of American  States It is being .tent to all Uni'ed Slates senators and  congressmen, and to u hundred and iiiiriy-two united Nations  delegations. Amnesty International is an independent, non- sectarian, and non-governmental organization, with in­ ternational headquarters in London and U.S. national  headquarters in New York. It has consultative status with the  United Nations, UNESCO, and the Council of Europe. On  September 5, 1972. the first part of this report, which includes  the names of 1,081 alleged victims of torture in Brazil, was  released. The second part, which appeared shortly thereafter,  contains the names of alleged torturers (see foreword by Sean  MacBride j: In his foreword, Mr. MacBride invites a response  from the Brazilian government. In Brazil, the only responses to  date have been repeated verbal attacks against Amnesty In­ ternational and a new press law forbidding the mention of  Amnesty's name.—The Editor.  Foreword  The Amnesty International inquiry into allegations of torture  in Brazil was carried out in April and May of 1972. As Brazil  has consistently refused to allow representatives of  organizations-such as the Organization of American States  and Amnesty International-to enter the country to investigate  reports of torture, the present report was compiled from  material available in Europe and North America. A  representative of Amnesty International has carefully  considered available documents in an effort to choose only the  most soundly based allegations for inclusion in this report.  As the Amnesty inquiry received no cooperation from the  authorities, its sources of information were necessarily  one-sided. Evaluation of the information received wis* thus based on subjective impressions of the complainant and his  account, viewed in the light of any corroborative or  contradictory evidence available. It was on this basis that the  deposition material was included here and conclusions drawn.  A response from the Brazilian government is invited.  The documents dealing with torture and homicide had beer:  sent to our representative by or on behalf of persons unable,  for various reasons, including continued imprisonment, to  report personally on their experience. In such cases where it  was not possible for the Amnesty representative to interview  those invoived, an effort was nonetheless maae to select  documents which appeared reliable and which were  corroborated by supportive material.  The names of victims and perpetrators of ill treatment  submitted to Amnesty International were so numerous that it  was decided to summarize the bulk of the material in the form  of indices. Two appendices [not included in the 1DOC  edition] have thus been drawn up: the first gives the names of  reported victims, while the second (confidential and available  only to a limited number of international organizations and  officials of the Brazilian government) gives 472 names of those  reported as responsible for ill treatment. Each entry in the two  appendices is cross-referenced to indicate the congruity of  multiple information sources.  The present report, necessarily limited and incomplete, deals  with the period from December 13, 1968 to July 15, 1972.  Although Brazil has not permitted an independent body of  observers to enter the country to investigate such charges, we  feel that such precise and specific accusations have been made  that it is difficult to discount their substance. We ask,  therefore, that the Brazilian government respond to the very  serious charges raised here, and that an independent  commission of inquiry be permitted to enter Brazil in order to  investigate, without restriction, accusations of serious  violations of Articles 5, 9, 18, and 19 of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights.  Sean MacBride  Chairman  International Executive Committee  Amnesty International SOC 14 HumanRights.RaceRelations 1975 Amnesty International‘s report on torture allegations in Brazil, submitted to various officials and organizations, highlights violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Compiled from available information due to the Brazilian government‘s refusal to allow investigations, the report lists 1,081 alleged torture victims and invites a response. It emphasizes the need for an independent inquiry into serious human rights violations."

Bolster, Director  Office of Aviation  U.S. Department of State  2201 G St., m  Washington, D.C. 20520  Dear Mr. Bolster:  I want to take this opportunity to bring you and  your office up-to-date on the progress of the ACCION  movement in Brazil, which you have been so instrumental  in helping to launch.  Since our last communication of over a year ago,  I spertfe^most all the year in Brazil helping to organize  the ACCION program in both Eio and Sao Paulo. I can  report that both are getting well-established and  creating strong roots among some 25,000 people of the  favelas of both cities. Boards of Directors of prominent  industrial and professional people have been set up in  both cities, a Brazilian staff picked and trained and  Brazilian field workers are actively engaged in slum  development programs in 10 different favelas. Community  centers, schools, vocational training, small business  and a number of other programs have already been organized. \\  The initial organizing phase has taken longer and  been more difficult than we expected, but now we are see­ ing results and it is evident that Brazilians, once they  undertake something, take off with great enthusiasm.  in We found that we were tackling a job considerably more  immense than we faced in Venezuela, a country ten times  the size and with problems more immense and with less re­ sources to handle them. As you know, Brazil nearly  suffered a Communist coup in April 196^ and it is still  vibrating from the shock.  I think the timing for the ACCION program has been  good. And certainly sueh a program is of vital importance  to the U.S. The G-overnor of the State of Guanabara, upon  handing out diplomas to the graduates of the first Community  Action course stated \"This is the first serious effort on  the part ef the Bra2ilian and American private sector to  J  DECLASSIFIED  Authority SOC 2 BRAZ ACCION International‘s communication from February 7, 1968, updates U.S. Department of State‘s Edward A. Bolster on the ACCION program‘s progress in Brazil. Established in Rio and Sao Paulo, it serves 25,000 people in slums with community centers, schools, and vocational training. The initiative is seen as crucial for U.S. interests in Brazil amid ongoing political tensions."
