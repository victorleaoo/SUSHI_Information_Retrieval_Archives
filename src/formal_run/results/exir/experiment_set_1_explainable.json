Since the Brazilian Military Mission is not an integral office  of the Embassy carried in the \"Diplomatie List\" of the Department  of State, a request for the establishment of reserved diplomatic  parking space may not be made by the Department under pertinent  regulations.  However, if the Eabassy desires that the signs formerly located  at the old address of the Mission on Leroy Place be placed at the  new location, it is possible that this can be done since the records  of the District of Columbia indicate that these signs were established  as early as 1955. The Embassy's attention is invited to the fact that  such signs, which, it is understood, read \"So Parking • Brasilia*.  Military Mission\" do not provide reserved parking space for any auto­ mobiles, even those belonging to the Mission.  -A S- Department ef Hate,  Washington. Septan 6, l96f I? 1 6 1365  9-15-65 Immunities. Privileges. The Department of State acknowledges a July 29, 1965 note from the Brazilian Embassy regarding parking signs for the Brazilian Military Mission at 4000 Brandywine Street. As the Mission isn‘t listed under “Diplomatic List,“ it can‘t request reserved parking. However, signs from the previous address may be relocated, but they do not provide reserved parking for Mission vehicles."

They  do not believe a reopened Congress will have a real role to  play because the present Government, dominated by the  Executive branch under military control, will set strict  ground rules for its operation. He stressed that no  Government guarantees have been given to the opposition and  that Congress will be revived only to provide a facade to  tranquilize and confuse foreign public opinion. Dr. Faria  said that almost no dynamic MDB leadership survived recent  cassations and that the existing opposition in Congress  would prove tame. He does not expect a freely operating  political process to get underway in Brazil for five years'S  at the minimum. Faria believes the Government may carry  out agrarian and other reforms Goulart could never have  accomplished and thus the military might strengthen its  hold on political power. He predicted that the Church  would move to more moderation and caution in the coming  two to three years and that no important clash with the  Government will occur. He said Goulart recently instructed  his followers to avoid creation of any problems for the  Rockefeller Mission to Brazil and he authorized ex-PTB  contact with the Embassy to explain the views of his group.  Faria said exile has matured Goulart and commented that  Goulart, though with a heart condition, is reasonably well.

Galba Samuel SANTOS presented his credentials as  Brazilian Ambassador to Haiti on February 16 in a  ceremony which marked the end of a long period of  skirmishing between the Government of Brazil and  President DUVALIER over the question of political  asylees in the Brazilian Embassy.  2. In January 1967 the Haitian Government had  granted agrement to the appointment of George Alvarez  MACIEL (Port-au-Prince 931), then Counselor of the  Brazilian Embassy in London, who was to have come to  Port-au-Prince in April. The Brazilian Charge d1  Affaires at the time, Joao DE MEDICIS, several times  expressed the hope to Foreign Minister Rene CHALMERS  that the asylees then in the Brazilian Embassy would  be permitted to leave before the new ambassador  arrived. The Haitians continued to delay their  decision on the latter question, and Maciel's  appointment had been changed by the time the Brazilian  Embassy was cleared of all asylees in April 1967.  3.

I visited Macei6 very briefly on May 11, leaving Recife at 6 a.m. to  arrive in Macei6 at 9:30 a.m. and returning the same day, to attend the  monthly SUDEKE Deliberative Council meeting. Attendance of the Council  meeting was only useful insofar as it gave me an opportunity to shake  a few hands. The meeting took place in the aioditorium of the Clube do  Trabalhador with an improvised sound system so poor that it was more  like watching a silent movie than a live stage show. A separate Airgram  will deal with the May SUDEKE meeting.  Most of ray time was spent with Jorge Arroxellas, the director of CODEAL  (Companhia de Desenvolvimento de Alagoas) who acts as the deputy to the  president, Afranio Lajes, a past senator for Alagoas under the UDN label.  According to Arroxellas, the principal recent industrial developaents  in Alagoas are the following:  1. Potentially most important are plans to exploit the vast rock  salt deposits which lie 90O meters below Maceio. On the basis of  Petrobras drillings starting in the late forties, this layer of p\\ire rock  salt extends over several square kilometers. A Bahian businessman,  Andrea Sasi, has been seeking to associate himself with an international  company having capital and know-how to develop a chemical industry using  the Alagoan rock salt. So far, negotiations have been principally between  Sasi and a BelgianCompany (Elekeiroz?) and Dow Chemical. Sesi is working  on a preliminary study of a project which would envolve an investment of  Crlllp billion for a chemical ccanplex to paoduce caustic soda, vinyl  and chlorine and derivatives. The plant would be one of the largest  built in the Northeast and by far the most important in Alagoas. CODEAL  personnel as well as other Ala^ans I had a chance to talk to expressed  great optimism concerning the project.  2. Sugar mill equipment plant representing an estimated investment  of Crll. h billion. All ^ sugar usinas in Alagoas are reported to have  agreed to become stockholders of a company which, in its initial stage,  would be equipped to manufacture 70^' of the equipment required by sugar  factories. The company would be a joint venture of the Alagoas usinas  (joined by a few Pernambuco usinas bordering on Alagoas) and Five-Lille,  the French sugar mill equipment manufacturer. Five-LiHe is reportedly  reluctant to coramit itself irrevocably until the craapany has been organized  and capitalized by the Alagoas and Pernambuco usinas. The importance of  the plant would be that it would free local mills from dependence on Sao  Paulo manufactxu'ers who are reportedly a year late on deliveries.  UKCL/\\SSIFIED E2 On May 11, 1966, a brief visit to Maceió, Alagoas was made to attend the SUDEKE Deliberative Council meeting. The meeting was poorly organized, serving mainly as a networking opportunity. Director Jorge Arroxellas highlighted two major industrial developments: exploiting rock salt deposits for a chemical complex, and establishing a sugar mill equipment plant through a joint venture to reduce reliance on São Paulo suppliers."

It seems  likely that Rui Palmeira will come out the winner, either by  ratification of a plurality or in a run-off against Muniz  Falcao. The campaign is tranfuil and arousing relatively  slight public interest. In Macei6, Divaldo Suruagy is the  probable next Mayor in a six-man race. The victory of Muniz  Falcao would represent a setback for the Revolution because of  his known links with Communism and Crime. This report is based  on a trip to Maceio* by the reporting officer on August 26 - 29,  1965.

Rui Palmeira appears favored, while Muniz Falcao‘s potential win may hinder the Revolution due to his Communist ties. Public interest is low, and Divaldo Suruagy is expected to succeed as Mayor of Maceió in a six-man race."

Birdsall, an e>pericnced tropical agriculturist  who had previously served in El Salvador, was the chief Advisor to this  project until the end of CY 67. This program has been unusually success­ ful in increasing the production of food grains, chiefly corn, on small  farms. Since increasing production of food grains and raising incomes of  small farmers are both items of high priority, Missions should investigate  a similar approach with host government officials and appropriate local  private enterprise'firms0  2\"., ' Some interesting features of the El Salvador program are: 1  a.  h.  c.  d.

In Porto Alegre, the Minister made a number of offi­ cial visits to various industrial and commercial entities, and attended the  inauguration of Banco Crefisul's new headquarters building. One of the high­ lights of Morais' visit was a meeting in the city of Novo Hamburgo with the  leaders of the local leather industry. During this meeting Mr. Morais stated  that the government intends to increase exports to 2.6 billion dollars in  1970, of which kOO million will consist of manufactured goods. He also  urged the industrialists of the state to increase production and to loweis  operating costs in order to become more competitive in the international  market.  On April 27, during a luncheon offered for the Minister by the Federation  of Commercial Associations and the Commercial Association of Porto Alegre,  Dr. Fabio Araujo Santos, president of both associations, criticized the  federal government and indirectly Minister Morais for the continuing  excessive tax load which he claimed impedes the commercial and industrial  entrepreneurs in their efforts to expand. Dr. Araujo Santos further stated  that this high tax load which the federal government imposes on the commer­ cial and industrial sectors works at cross purposes with the government's  announced intention of stimulating and assisting in the development of the  state's economic infra-structure.  In reply, Minister Morais argued that the gaucho entrepreneurs have a  responsibility just as their counterparts in the rest of the country have  to share in the cost of progress and prosperity. He added that most of the  taxes that are presently levied on the sale of manufactured products are  ^jbhe minimum which the government can afford to charge.

C, 20510  Dear Senator Proxmlre;  I am pleased to reply to your letter dated August 11, 1971  in which you express concern about fears in Uruguay of a  possible Brazilian military intervention and request  justification for continuation of our Military Assistance  Program and Foreign Credit Sales to those two countries.  As the newspaper stories enclosed with your letter indicate,  many Uruguayans appear to be concerned about the possibility  of a Brazilian military intervention. As a small and lightly -=^s^  populated country between its two large neighbors of Argentina \\T\\  and Brazil, Uruguay has always been very sensitive to reports v>>  which even hint at the possibility of foreign intervention,  (especially from those countries), even though Argentina  and Brazil have not intervened in Uruguay in this century.  The principle of \"non-intervention\" has long been the  cardinal tenet of Uruguayan foreign policy. Thus when  reports appear such as those in the clippings attached to  your letter, they understandably cause anxiety in Uruguay.  Whatever the attitude of the Government of Brazil may be  toward the outcome of the forthcoming Uruguayan election,  we are confident that the Brazilian Government would honor  the commitments to non-intervention contained in the Charter  of the Organization of American States, the Inter-American  Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty of 1947), and ^ ^  other Inter-American declarations. Furthermore, official ^  relations between Brazil and Uruguay appear to be quite  harmonious, as most recently exemplified by an agreement  this month in which Brazil granted Uruguay a 10 month  moratorium on Uruguay's $14.5 million debt to Brazil, as  well as a $7.5 million export credit.  Jo  i  7$> INTERNAL SECURITY. COUNTER-INSURGENCY. In response to Senator Proxmlre‘s August 11, 1971 letter, concerns about potential Brazilian military intervention in Uruguay were addressed. Despite Uruguay‘s anxiety over foreign intervention, Brazil is expected to honor non-intervention commitments. Additionally, relations between Brazil and Uruguay remain positive, highlighted by Brazil granting Uruguay a 10-month debt moratorium and an export credit of $7.5 million."

The National Congress in its current revision of the  remittance of profits law \"must\" produce legislation  more acceptable to foreign investors.  2. The present Administration of Brazil has adopted an  economic policy which is correct in its objectives but  authorities are trying to move too fast. In particular  the government should provide more ample credit  facilities.  3. There is little prospect of a significant increase in  exports of manufactured goods in the near future.

Department of State June 3, 1%9  DEPARTMENT OF STATE  POST DIFFERENTIAL QUESTIONNAIRE FORM APPROVED  BUDGET BUREAU NO. 47-R07S.7  INSTRUCTIONS  The Overseas Differentials and Allowances Act (Public Law 86-707) authorizes the payment of post differentials to United States  civilian employees of Government establishments in foreign areas. The information required in this form is for determining whether suf­ ficiently adverse living conditions exist at a place to warrant payment of a post differential and, if so, what rate of payment is appropri­ ate. Guidance on which posts are requited to report is contained in sections 072.11 and 072.12, Standardized Regulations (Government  Civilians, Foreign Areas).  Reporting officers should answer each applicable question objectively, giving detailed explanations where necessary. If the spaces  provided ate insufficient, use extra pages.  Many questions refer to situations and conditions which may not be the same in their effect on all employees at a post. Repotting  officers should describe these situations and conditions as they affect the majority of eligible civilian employees. (See section 031-3,  Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas)). Reporting officers should consult the judgment of a representative  cross-section of the staff, where appropriate, before completing the questionnaire. This may be done, for example, through discussions  with a committee composed of married men and women with and without children, single men and women, high and low salaried employees,  those who like and dislike the post.  If a post contains two distinct environments as, for example, an enclosed base or compound area in or near a native town, the re­ porting officer should phrase his replies so as to make it cleat to which environment he refers.

Wide rivers, steaming rain forests, sleepy river towns with dugout  canoes and barges and isolated Indian tribes—all are present to some  extent. With the exception of its capital, Manaus, and a few minor  cities such as Itacoatiara and Parintins, the state remains what is has  been for centuries past-^?^nconquered and unexplored natural reserve  which may, or may not, possess potential for economic development.  While its politics, since the Revolution, have moved toward greater  enlightenment, honesty and governmental concern for social problems,  its economy has improved but little. Caboclas still collect^ rubber and  Brazil nuts, using the same methods of their fathers and grandfathers.  The majority of the businessmen, particularly in the inteyrior, still  view their role in terms of paternalism, a euphemism for keeping wages  and prices paid for harvested products as low as passible. Although  Amazonas is Brazil's largest state (about ^ar times the area of Texas),  its population, which lives wholly aling the Amazon and its tributaries,  is estimated at only 800,000, ^ardly more than a couple of large bairros  in Rio de Janeiro, This is in spite of a high birth rate, for it continues  to lose much of its educated y^uth to more advanced urban areas such as  Belem and southern Brazil, which offer greater opportunity.  The Economy  It is not innacurate to say that Amazonas still suffers from the  effects of the rubber boom era and its subsequent demise. Its economy  is largely based on the same extractive crops of \"^O to ICX) years ago. POL13-1 PoliticalAffairs&RelLaborOrganizations The Amazonas state of Brazil embodies the classic Amazon jungle experience, with vast rivers, rainforests, and isolated tribes. Despite political advancements, its economy remains stagnant, relying on traditional methods for rubber and Brazil nut collection. With only 800,000 residents, most live along the rivers, and educated youth emigrate for better opportunities. Its economy still reflects the outdated rubber boom era."

The motion was carried by 88 votes against 60.  Thirteen Labor members, including three of the most influential  (Halvard LANGE, Finn MOE and Nils H0NSVALD), voted with the  majority, while three Center Party representatives and one Liberal  voted against giving the guarantee.  Whereas alleged adverse domestic implications of Borregaard's  planned move of its chemical pulp production to Brazil (i.a.,  reduced demand for domestic timber) loomed large in the Storting  debate last July, such considerations aroused little controversy  this time. Statements obtained by the Government from the pulp and  paper and forest industry indicate that there are few problems  involved in finding new buyers for Borregaard's current consumption  of domestic timber. (Borregaard buys a maximum of 200,000 cubic  meters of domestic timber. Norway's total imparts of timber from  abroad are currently 2-3 million cubic meters annually.) Borregaard's  move to Brazil may even prove directly beneficial for Norway in  that Borregaard will be able to offer a grade of short-fiber  chemical pulp which is not produced domestically and which is used  in ever increasing quantities by the paper industry.  The opposition against the state guarantee centered around  development aid aspects of the Borregaard Brazil project.

The recommendation received broad support, with key Labor leaders backing it. The project, aimed at establishing a chemical pulp mill, may benefit Norway by enhancing pulp production options, alleviating prior domestic opposition."

In Porto Alegre, the Minister made a number of offi­ cial visits to various industrial and commercial entities, and attended the  inauguration of Banco Crefisul's new headquarters building. One of the high­ lights of Morais' visit was a meeting in the city of Novo Hamburgo with the  leaders of the local leather industry. During this meeting Mr. Morais stated  that the government intends to increase exports to 2.6 billion dollars in  1970, of which kOO million will consist of manufactured goods. He also  urged the industrialists of the state to increase production and to loweis  operating costs in order to become more competitive in the international  market.  On April 27, during a luncheon offered for the Minister by the Federation  of Commercial Associations and the Commercial Association of Porto Alegre,  Dr. Fabio Araujo Santos, president of both associations, criticized the  federal government and indirectly Minister Morais for the continuing  excessive tax load which he claimed impedes the commercial and industrial  entrepreneurs in their efforts to expand. Dr. Araujo Santos further stated  that this high tax load which the federal government imposes on the commer­ cial and industrial sectors works at cross purposes with the government's  announced intention of stimulating and assisting in the development of the  state's economic infra-structure.  In reply, Minister Morais argued that the gaucho entrepreneurs have a  responsibility just as their counterparts in the rest of the country have  to share in the cost of progress and prosperity. He added that most of the  taxes that are presently levied on the sale of manufactured products are  ^jbhe minimum which the government can afford to charge.

I visited Macei6 very briefly on May 11, leaving Recife at 6 a.m. to  arrive in Macei6 at 9:30 a.m. and returning the same day, to attend the  monthly SUDEKE Deliberative Council meeting. Attendance of the Council  meeting was only useful insofar as it gave me an opportunity to shake  a few hands. The meeting took place in the aioditorium of the Clube do  Trabalhador with an improvised sound system so poor that it was more  like watching a silent movie than a live stage show. A separate Airgram  will deal with the May SUDEKE meeting.  Most of ray time was spent with Jorge Arroxellas, the director of CODEAL  (Companhia de Desenvolvimento de Alagoas) who acts as the deputy to the  president, Afranio Lajes, a past senator for Alagoas under the UDN label.  According to Arroxellas, the principal recent industrial developaents  in Alagoas are the following:  1. Potentially most important are plans to exploit the vast rock  salt deposits which lie 90O meters below Maceio. On the basis of  Petrobras drillings starting in the late forties, this layer of p\\ire rock  salt extends over several square kilometers. A Bahian businessman,  Andrea Sasi, has been seeking to associate himself with an international  company having capital and know-how to develop a chemical industry using  the Alagoan rock salt. So far, negotiations have been principally between  Sasi and a BelgianCompany (Elekeiroz?) and Dow Chemical. Sesi is working  on a preliminary study of a project which would envolve an investment of  Crlllp billion for a chemical ccanplex to paoduce caustic soda, vinyl  and chlorine and derivatives. The plant would be one of the largest  built in the Northeast and by far the most important in Alagoas. CODEAL  personnel as well as other Ala^ans I had a chance to talk to expressed  great optimism concerning the project.  2. Sugar mill equipment plant representing an estimated investment  of Crll. h billion. All ^ sugar usinas in Alagoas are reported to have  agreed to become stockholders of a company which, in its initial stage,  would be equipped to manufacture 70^' of the equipment required by sugar  factories. The company would be a joint venture of the Alagoas usinas  (joined by a few Pernambuco usinas bordering on Alagoas) and Five-Lille,  the French sugar mill equipment manufacturer. Five-LiHe is reportedly  reluctant to coramit itself irrevocably until the craapany has been organized  and capitalized by the Alagoas and Pernambuco usinas. The importance of  the plant would be that it would free local mills from dependence on Sao  Paulo manufactxu'ers who are reportedly a year late on deliveries.  UKCL/\\SSIFIED E2 On May 11, 1966, a brief visit to Maceió, Alagoas was made to attend the SUDEKE Deliberative Council meeting. The meeting was poorly organized, serving mainly as a networking opportunity. Director Jorge Arroxellas highlighted two major industrial developments: exploiting rock salt deposits for a chemical complex, and establishing a sugar mill equipment plant through a joint venture to reduce reliance on São Paulo suppliers."

The National Congress in its current revision of the  remittance of profits law \"must\" produce legislation  more acceptable to foreign investors.  2. The present Administration of Brazil has adopted an  economic policy which is correct in its objectives but  authorities are trying to move too fast.

GAUDY, addressed the last meeting of the Federa­ tion's directors. On the possibility of large-scale British investments  in Brazil, Mr* Gandy said that this would be difficult at the moment  because after two world wars Britain's resources are limited and she has  numerous commitments to former colonies. Britain's present interest is  to maintain relations and to seek to give technical collaboration to  Brazil,  2» In response to questions, Mr. Gandy said that Britain could assist the  textile industry by supplying equipment not made in Brazil, financed by  producers at reasonable terms. While it would be difficult to grant  terms of more than five years, the subject is being studied and, should  Brazil's economic-financial situation continue to strengthen, it is  possible that the terms will be modified,  3, In response to an observation that Brazil also needs investment,  Mr. Gandy suggested that Britain's difficulties are transitory and that  future possibilities for f.oreign investment should be good. In this  program, Brazil will certainly be included*  4, Comment; The Consulate General regularly hears reports of increasing  German and Japanese investment and commercial activity in Brazil.

The following biographic sketch focuses on the  man and his performance in these fields.  Ernesto Geisel, the discreet general, efficient and dedicated administrator, the retiring intellectual chess player, is the son of an immigrant. He is the youngest of five children of a hardworking German Protestant school teacher who educated three of his four sons for the Army. All three became generals.  Geisel is a military officer who has spent a good part of  his career in non-traditional military billets, including a number  of years in administrative jobs, some ox them civilian.  The future President's first taste of the problems of  governing came after the 1930 Vargas revolution when as a  young lieutenant he was stationed in the Northeast.

A-533, Dec. 6, 1966  r n  1. The Embassy's airgram under reference transmitted a  free translation of decree law No. 44, Nov. 18, 1966,  extending Brazil's territorial sea from three to six miles  and establishing an additional six-mile exclusive fisheries  jurisdiction.  2. It is the position of the United States that there is no  obligation on it under international law to recognize  unilateral claims to a territorial sea in excess of three  nautical miles and it is the policy of the United States in  the event of such a claim to formally put its position on  record and to reserve its rights and those of its nationals  in the claimed territorial sea beyond three miles. The  Embassy is instructed to send a note in these terms to the  Foreign Office.  3. The Department considers that the establishment of a  contiguous zone to a limit of twelve miles from the baseline  from which the territorial sea is measured in which customs,  fiscal, immigration and sanitary control is exercised, as  well as the exercise of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction in  such an area, are in accordance with international practice  and it raises no objection thereto.  4.

Murray  Office of Brazilian Affairs  Bureau for Latin America  Agency for International Development  Washington, D. C.  Dear Gini:  This will be a short letter today just to keep you advised of various  odds and ends.  As of the end of May, we were approximately 83 percent obligated which  is our best record for several years. However, we are still apparently  a few points below the regional average, dam It.  While we have not yet received the FY 1970 CAP Instructions, we have  begun to set certain wheels in motion here. Enclosed you will find a  memorandum which was sent to all divisions to encourage them to begin  preparation on the budget sheets. A set of the budget sheets are also  enclosed. Most divisions seem anxious to get this part of the exercise  out of the way. If we are successful in this respect, it may reduce  substantially the trauma usually associated with the preparation of the  CAP, assuming AH>/w does not have some surprises in the Instructions.  Also enclosed is a copy of a memorandum to the various divisions con­ cerning the preparation of the PASA PIC/T's for FY 1969. The newly  revised Manual Order 712.4 may cause seme slippage in fee target date  (July 31) for submission of fee PIO/T's. As you probably are aware,  this M.0. requires the obligation of PASA and participant funds by  Project Agreement. While we do not anticipate any significant prob­ lems in preparing these ProAg's, it is an additional burden upon us  during this season and will necessitate additional time for completing  this exercise. We will be advising Washington shortly about a couple  of specific problems we have with M.0. 712.4, such as how to handle  the USDA PASA projects and the obligation of Trust Fund items.  We were somewhat shocked by Beraie Gilbert's recent message which indi­ cated feat substantial deobligations in prior year funds for certain  PASA's, such as fee BPR, could be effected. We thought we had the PASA  UNCLASSIFIED PRM1-2 Assistance Plans 2 On June 3, 1960, Mrs. Virginia S. Murray from the Office of Brazilian Affairs reported an 83% obligation rate, below the regional average. Preparations for the FY 1970 CAP have begun despite pending instructions. Additionally, challenges regarding the revised Manual Order 712.4 may delay submissions. Concerns over potential deobligations in prior year funds were also expressed."

In part, this reflects the ideological  commitment to an independent and nationalist foreign  policy by the Foreign Minister and other influential  figures in the Ministry and in part a desire by these men  to overcome their isolation from Brazilian society and  strengthen their position with those in power. The posi­ tions taken have struck a responsive note in the press and  Congress and improved the Foreign Minister,s public image.  They have also forced President Medici to exert a modera­ ting role reflecting the broader long term interests of  the country as he sees them.  1. Under its present leadership, the Brazilian  Foreign Office (Itamaraty) plays a special and somewhat  unusual role in the formulation of Brazil's foreign  policy. Its input into the policy formation process is  often aggressive and nationalist in viewpoint and narrow«  and partisan in character.
